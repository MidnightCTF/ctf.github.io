Welcome to my CTF writeups blog. I am a dedicated high school student with a strong commitment to cybersecurity, specializing in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges and cryptographic principles. My journey is driven by a desire to build technical expertise while contributing to the greater goal of defending individuals and organizations from cybersecurity threats. I am particularly focused on advancing my knowledge in cryptography, penetration testing, and ethical hacking practices.

Through my blog, I share my writeups and insights to help others learn, improve, and stay secure. My goal is to make a meaningful impact by defending as many people as possible from online threats. Whether it’s digging into the details of a challenging puzzle or breaking down complex security concepts, I’m here to share my learning path with you. Let’s build a safer digital world together!
